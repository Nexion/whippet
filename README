Whippet README


For usage information, execute the command: man whippet
For a log of changes, see: /usr/share/doc/whippet/CHANGELOG

Whippet also comes with:

1) A basic configuration file: /usr/share/doc/whippet/whippet.conf
which should be copied to ~/.config/whippet/whippet.conf and customized for the user.

2) An example of the database file: /usr/share/doc/whippet/whippet_example.sqlite
which may be copied to ~/.config/whippet/whippet.sqlite and customized for the user.
Alternatively, let Whippet create a fresh database there the first time it is run.

3) An example of an Openbox pipe menu script: /usr/share/doc/whippet/whippet_obpipemenu
which provides a menu of the most frequently used applications known to Whippet.
This menu should be copied to Openbox's configuration directory and then called from
Openbox's menu.xml file.

4) A replacement for freedesktop.org's 'xdg-open' command: /usr/share/doc/whippet/xdg-open
Copy the script to somewhere on the user's PATH before /usr/bin, for example /usr/local/bin,
or create a symbolic link to run the script instead.

5) An example of a dmenu-based helper script: /usr/share/doc/whippet/dudo
which can be copied to somewhere on the user's PATH, for example /usr/local/bin.
Set the environment variable SUDO_ASKPASS=/path/dudo and then dudo will be used by
sudo when asking for a password with the -A or --askpass option (see: man sudo).
