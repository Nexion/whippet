                   redundant applications which have no database entry or desktop file.
                   New functions ldbap and ldesk list databased and desktop applications. Function Desktop now returns array of (path,Name,Icon).

                   Add option -k to open objects with any desktop application on system. Add options -u/-U to backup/restore application
                   usage data and last vacuum time from/to database.
